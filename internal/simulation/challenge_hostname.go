// The name the player is asked about.
//
// A challenge base names its target in its own YAML (example.test,
// secure-target.test, subnet-target.test) which made the hostname a fingerprint
// of the base rather than a property of the challenge. Seeing secure-target.test
// told a returning player they were on tls-valid, which is most of the way to
// the answer for two of the conditions, and the base is precisely what the
// briefing is not allowed to disclose.
//
// So the target gets a name of its own, derived from the id and nothing else:
// deterministic, unique to the challenge, identical on replay, and carrying no
// information about the base, the case or the fault. It is a real part of the
// simulated network: the rename goes through the DNS zone the node's resolver
// serves, through the certificates that have to cover it, and through the target
// the graded netdoc run is handed, so nothing about it can disagree with the
// evidence.

// challengeHostSuffix is the reserved TLD RFC 6761 set aside for exactly this:
// a name that no public resolver may ever answer, so the zone is answerable
// inside the simulation and nowhere else. It is also what every base scenario
// already uses, so a challenge host is the same kind of name as the rest of the
// simulated network rather than a new convention beside it.
//
// Deliberately not a `.challenge.test` label, tempting as it is to say so out
// loud. The primary target is passed to the graded netdoc run as its argument,
// and TestRunChallengeOrderAndNetdocArguments exists to keep the simulator from
// handing that process any token telling it a challenge is happening. What marks
// the name as this challenge's is the id in it, which the player is holding
// anyway.

// would run. Ordered API: the word is picked by index, so reordering this list
// renames every existing challenge's host.
//
// Deliberately none of them names a network layer, a protocol or a failure
// mode. A host called `dns-gateway` would be a hint, and a host called
// `broken-thing` would be two.
