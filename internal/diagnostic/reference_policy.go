// An ordinary run contacts a handful of destinations nobody asked it to
// contact: fixed anycast addresses that stand in for "the internet", two
// captive-portal observation points, a public resolver, a fixed QUIC endpoint,
// a fixed encrypted-DNS provider, and one compiled-in hostname a targetless
// run resolves so there is a DNS question to ask at all. None of it is
// telemetry, and all of it is visible in a firewall log, a proxy log, an IDS
// alert, and a packet capture, which is enough to make it the wrong traffic on
// a restricted host.
//
// This file is the one place that says which probes that describes. It is read
// twice and nowhere else: buildProbes marks the graph it just built, and the
// CLI asks for the same answer by name so it can refuse a --check that
// contradicts the flag, and hand the resolved decision to a --via worker as
// ordinary skips rather than as a protocol field the worker might not know.
//
// TestNoReferenceEgressAttemptsNoBuiltInDestination is what keeps this honest.
// It denies every built-in destination at the netops seam and runs the whole
// DAG, so a new fixed reference probe that never confronted this policy fails
// there instead of shipping.

// referenceEgress reports whether one probe's traffic is aimed at Network
// Doctor's own reference infrastructure in a run of this shape.
//
// Provenance decides it, not who happens to own an address. hasTarget says the
// user named an endpoint, which is what turns the DNS row from "resolve a
// compiled-in name so there is connectivity evidence" into "resolve the name
// that was asked about". publicDNSNamed says --public-dns chose the
// second-opinion resolver, which makes that row's destination one the user
// picked rather than one netdoc picked for them.
